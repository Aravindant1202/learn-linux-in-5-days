Linux Directory structure:
==========================

 /    - Root Directory, the top of the file system hierarchy.

 /bin - Binaries and other executable programs. Binaries are just 0's and 1'structure.

 /etc - Contains system configuration files. Control how OS/Apps behave.

 /home - User home directories. Store documents. 

 /opt - optinal or 3rd party s/w lives. Google Earth gets installed in /opt.

 /temp - Temporary space,typically cleared on reboot.

 /usr - User related programs live.

 /var - variable data. Data that changes often.



Comprehensive Directory structure:
==================================

 /boot - Files needed to boot the OS.

 /cdrom - mount point for CD ROM's 

 /cgroup - Control Groups hierarchy.

 /dev - Device files, typically controlled by the OS and sysadmin's.

 /export - Shared file systems.

 /lib - System Libraries.

 /lib64 - System Libraries, 64 bit

 /lost+found - used by the file system to store recovered files after a file system check has been performed.

 /media - Used to mount removable media like CD ROM's

 /mnt - used to mount external file system.

 /proc - provides info about running processes.

 /root - the home directory for the root account.

 /sbin - system administrators binaries.

 /selinux - used to display info about SELinux. ( Security Enhanced Linux is a linux kernel security module that provides mechanism for supporting access control policies including US DoD style Mandatory Access Control(MAC))


Other Linux Distro's:
======================

/srv - Contains data  which is served by the system.

/srv/www - Web server files.

/srv/ftp - FTP files.

/sys - used to display and configure the devices known to the linux kernel.

/tmp - Temporary space,typically cleared on reboot.


User related directories:
===========================

    /usr - user related programs,files and docs.

    /usr/bin - Binaries and other executable programs.

    /usr/lib - Libraries

    /usr/local - Locally installed s/w that is not part of the base operating system.

    /usr/sbin - System administrators binaries.

    /var - variable data, mostly notably log files.

    /var/log - Log files.
