Directory Permissions:
======================


Permissions on a directory can effect the files in the directory.
If the file Permissions look correct,start checking directory permissions.
Work your way up to the root.


    File creation mask:
    =================

        File creation mask determines default file permissions

        If no mask were used permissions would be:

            777 for directories
            666 for files

    The umask command:
    =====================

        umask  [-s] [mode]

        Sets the creation mask to mode, if given.
        Uses -S for Symbolic notation.
